Moderation Request Action
================================================

Each :ref:`workflow_step` must be assigned to a Role. This allows the moderation system to know the set of valid `Reviewers` for that step. Once that `Reviewer` acts on a given :ref:`moderation_request`, their action is recorded as a :ref:`moderation_request_action`.
