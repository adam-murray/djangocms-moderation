Workflow
================================================
The moderation workflow system is designed to be flexible enough that it can cater for a multi-step approval workflow. E.g. if your organisation has `marketing`, `legal` and `compliance` departments who each need to approve every request, you would add 3 steps to your workflow, each assigned to a different Role. The workflow would require each step to be approved before the :ref:`moderation_request` could be published.

Workflows are designed to be extensible and customisable for developers.
